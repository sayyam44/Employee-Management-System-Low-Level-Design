# Employee-Management-System-Low-Level-Design
This project aims to design and implement an Employee Management System using 8 different design patterns. Below is the list of used design patterns:

Adapter
Abstract Factory
Bridge
Chain of responsibility
Decorator
Facade

Strategy

## Key functionalities supported by the Employee Management System include:
1. Adding new employee: It allows the HR department to add new employees to the system. 
The user has the option to include various details while adding an employee such as employee 
id, name, age, designation, salary/hourly pay depending upon the status of the employee (Full 
time/Part time).
2. Deleting employee: This function allows the HR department to remove the employee from 
the system upon separation i.e resignation, termination, retirement.
3. List employees: This allows the HR department to retrieve the list of employees including 
their associated parameters like Employee ID, name, age, designation, salary details.
4. Save to file: The system allows the user to save all the employee records to a binary file 
(.pkl) for storage and future retrieval.
